                  Our lowest cost stand is perfect for occasional use and
                  displaying posters at a fixed height of 2 metres. Unzip the
                  carry case, flip out the feet, snap the 3 part pole together
                  and unroll the poster. You'll be surprised just how huge these
                  Blurb Banner Stands look.
