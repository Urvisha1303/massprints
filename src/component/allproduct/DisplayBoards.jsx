                To help as many people as possible, The London Printers accepts
                a range of different formats. These are: JPEG, PNG, PDF.
              </li>
              <li>
                For the photography artwork we would recommend high resolution
                JPEGs (preferably un-compressed).

              <li>
                For a mix of graphics and photography artwork the best solution
                would be print-ready PDFs.
